title: "早安吉祥：一順風飄過不再回來，順理為悟，順事為迷，迷則迷自本心，悟則悟自本性！ <br> Good morning and auspiciousness: Once a favorable wind passes by, it will never come back. Following the principles is enlightenment, while following the facts is confusion. If you are confused, you will be confused by your own heart. If you are enlightened, you will be enlightened by your own nature!"
